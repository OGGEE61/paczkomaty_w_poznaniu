This is a simple project where I tried to replicate an appraoch of two authors, whose article I read on a medium. The main differences are the programming lagauge Python vs R and the fact the I wanted do recteare the analysis for Poznan, unfortunetly currently I coudlnt get my hands on a shape file with Poznan's districts. I will try to get it and update the project.
